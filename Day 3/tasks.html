                <h2>ARKET and Massproductions bring practicality and playfulness into the home.</h2>
                <p>It was an easy “yes” when ARKET invited us to collaborate. We are not only admirers and customers of
                    ARKET
                    stores and their products, but also neighbours on the island of Södermalm in central Stockholm. That
                    made
                    the project easier to manage, but probably also meant that we have similar values in terms of
                    culture,
                    design, and outlook on what a product should embody. No wonder then that we proudly present these
                    five
                    products as a truly symbiotic collaboration between ARKET and Massproductions.</p>
